Hereâ€™s a quick look at each of the apps, and why we like them!\nIn case youâ€™re not familiar with Toca Boca, their appsâ€”available for iOS and Androidâ€”are all about digital play. Most of them are more like toys than games, because you donâ€™t have a specific end goal. Theyâ€™re more about exploration and make-believe, so most of them are not like what you usually think of as â€œvideogames.â€ The Toca Life apps are a great example of that.\nToca Boca provided me with download codes for Toca Life: Pets, Toca Life: Vacation, Toca Life: Hospital, and Toca Labs: Plants.

The clothes they were wearing before will turn into a neatly folded pile, ready to be put away.
